This script was tested with ROXIE 10.2

To convert your ROXIE calculation:

1. make sure that your Python installation has numpy and scipy installed
   (when in doubt, change the shebang "#!/usr/bin/env python3" so that
    it points to the python distribution you wand to use)
1. make sure that the paths for the iron and the cables are set up
2. run Roxie
3. call the script ../rox2vtk dipole.data
4. enjoy the dipole.vtk in the beautiful world of ParaView
